  <p class="bioInfo">
    My name is Jeffrey Smith from Charlottesville VA. I received my degree in Information Technology from Bryant & Stratton University and then went on upon graduation to serve in the US Army. From there I transitioned to a career
    in technology. I am currently a student at Code Fellows in Seattle with the goal of becoming a web developer and working for a Company locally in Seattle. I am married and currently reside in Seattle WA where I enjoy woodworking. For fun I enjoy traveling with my wife. Fun fact to know about me is I have no fear of heights allowing me to use that skill as a paratrooper at Fort Bragg where I completed 100 of jumps.</p>
